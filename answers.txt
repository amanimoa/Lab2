problem 1:

in problem one the mistake the student made is that he/she
did not assign the right raw and col and instead had two raws by mistake
therefore to fix this mistake we just replace the second raw with col to match
the rest. invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] = new Warrior(); to invaders[invader$

problem 2:

; remove

problem 3:

student forgot to increameant the for loop so it was stuck.

problem 4:

when deleting the memory in the main
switch between n and m

problem 5:

the logic was worng where there were (<) in the wrong direction. Moreover,
I used gdp and break points to go through the function and if statements
one by one to figure out what was wrong.
